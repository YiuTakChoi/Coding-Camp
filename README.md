<h3>1. Code for data structure course written in CPP language</h3>
<h3>2. Make sure to push your code into the correct directory</h3>
<p>The code should be pushed into the file directory with your name on. For example, there is a directory named: Jeremy, which is my name. My submission of the code therefore, should be under this specific directory.</p>
<h3>3. Creating new direcotry and file access</h3>
<p>If you are new here, make sure to create a new different file path, lets say, John Doe, then, should create a file path called John Doe and submit his code under that directory.
Codes in this whole repository are allowed to download, so feel free to download and review any code you are interested in.
